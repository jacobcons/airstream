					<h2>FAQ</h2>
					<p>
						<span class="question">What equipment do you use to take photographs?</span>
						<span class="answer">We use a professional nikon DSLR camera with a wide angle lens. Our studio lighting set up consists of 2 compact Bowens dish lights and occasionally an additional background light.</span>
					</p>

					<p>
						<span class="question">How many people can I get in one photograph?</span>
						<span class="answer">It is possible to squeeze up to 8 people into a photo but in our experience groups of up to 6 are more enjoyable and you won't feel like you are treading on each others toes!</span>
					</p>

					<p>
						<span class="question">How many times can guests use the Photo Booth?</span>
						<span class="answer">The booth is normally hired for a set amount of time and guests are free to use it as many times as they wish. They may have to rejoin the back of the line though as it is very popular.</span>
					</p>

					<p>
						<span class="question">When is the best time to host a Photo Booth?</span>
						<span class="answer">For weddings, generally after the meal and speeches. For other events it is best that the booth does not clash with any structured part of the function.</span>
					</p>

					<p>
						<span class="question">How long do I need?</span>
						<span class="answer">For events of up to 150 people, 3 hours is normally enough. It is usually possible to add extra hours to the booking time on the day if you wish.</span>
					</p>

					<p>
						<span class="question">What standard themes can I choose?</span>
						<span class="answer">Currently our pre-made sets are vintage, nautical or burlesque.
					</p>

					<p>
						<span class="question">Can I ask for a custom theme?</span>
						<span class="answer">Of course! We love taking on creative projects and are happy to quote for sourcing a set for any theme you can imagine.</span>
					</p>

					<p>
						<span class="question">What about props?</span>
						<span class="answer">We have a dressing up box full of wigs, hats, parasols and quirky items as well as a suitcase full of glasses, pipes and masks. We are always adding items to our collection.</span>
					</p>

					<p>
						<span class="question">What do the hosts do?</span>
						<span class="answer">Our 2 hosts are there to help guide your guests through the Airstream Studio experience. They also make sure the automated set up is running properly and are on hand for anyone who isn't used to using an iPad and social media.</span>
					</p>

					<p>
						<span class="question">What is a Private Champagne Shoot?</span>
						<span class="answer">
							We provide an unhurried photo shoot with complimentary champagne for a group of up to six people. This is very popular with wedding parties, brides and brides maids etc. You have the option to use the automated photo booth or have one of the hosts take your pictures for you. You can print as many pictures as you like and we will send you a professionally edited digital album within 48 hours of the event.
